Materials for Linux 101 hands on workshop.

See the [documentation](docs).

### Summary

Cloud-native principles and platforms have changed how we design, build and run software. In this short course, we will provide a hands-on introduction to the Kubernetes container orchestration platform, giving you a working understanding of how you can use it to repeatably deliver software quickly and safely. We will also cover the theory behind building cloud-native architectures and introduce the tools you can use to apply this to your projects.
